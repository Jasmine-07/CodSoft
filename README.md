# Task1- CALCULATOR
I have designed a simple calculator using Python, with basic arithmetic operations. 
It prompts the user to input two numbers and an operation choice. It then performs the calculation and displays the result.
Four functions (add, subtract, multiply, and divide) are defined. Each function takes two arguments a and b, performs the respective mathematical operation on them, and prints the result in a human-readable format.
The code prints a menu for the user to choose from: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, or Exit.
It takes the user's choice as input using input() and stores it in the variable choice.
Depending on the user's choice, it enters one of the conditional blocks (if-elif) to perform the selected operation:
If choice is "a" or "A," it performs addition.
If choice is "b" or "B," it performs subtraction.
If choice is "c" or "C," it performs multiplication.
If choice is "d" or "D," it performs division.
If choice is "e" or "E," it quits the program.
For each operation (e.g., addition), the code prompts the user for two numbers (a and b) and then calls the respective function (add, subtract, multiply, or divide) with these values to perform the operation and print the result.
If the user chooses "e" or "E" to exit, the program prints "Exiting" and quits using the quit() function.

# Task2- To Do List
I designed a GUI- based, 'To-Do List' application using Python , that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. This application allows users to create, update, and track their to-do lists.
The application consists of:
Listbox: It's like a list where we can put tasks one below the other, and we can click on them to choose them.
Scrollbars: They help us manage lots of tasks without worrying about the space on the window. We can move up and down to see all the tasks in the list.
Frame: Think of it as a container where we put things like the list of tasks and the scrollbars. It helps us arrange them neatly, with the list on the left and the scrollbar on the right.
Buttons: There are two buttons. One lets us add more tasks to the list, and the other lets us delete tasks from the list.
Entry box: This is where users type the tasks they want to add to the list. Whatever they type here shows up in the list.
Messagebox: If someone tries to add a task without typing anything in the entry box, a message pops up to tell them they need to enter something.

# Task3 - Password Generator
This tool aims to create a password generator application using Python, allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password.
The function takes three arguments: minlength (the minimum length of the password), numbers (a boolean indicating whether to include numbers in the password), and special_characters (a boolean indicating whether to include special characters in the password).
It sets up strings of characters:
->letters contains all alphabetical letters (both lowercase and uppercase).
->digits contains all digits (0-9).
->special contains all special punctuation characters.
->character initially set to letters, but it can include digits and special characters based on user preferences.
The function initializes password as an empty string and sets some flags (meets_criteria, has_number, has_special) to False.
It enters a while loop that continues until the password meets certain criteria or is at least as long as minlength.
Inside the loop, it randomly selects a character from the character pool and adds it to the password.
It checks if the newly added character is a digit or a special character and updates the respective flags (has_number and has_special).
It checks whether the meets_criteria flag is set to True. If numbers are required, it checks if has_number is True, and if special_characters are required, it checks if has_special is True. This ensures that the generated password meets the specified criteria.
Finally, the function returns the generated password.
